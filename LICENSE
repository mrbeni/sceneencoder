This software may also invoke mkvmerge or FFmpeg, if available.

FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.
mkvmerge is Copyright (C) 2005-2016, Matroska.

Unlike the above software, neither mkvmerge nor FFmpeg is not distributed
with PySceneDetect, and requires manual installation in order to allow
for automatic video splitting capability. These programs can be obtained
from following URLs (note mkvmerge is a part of the MKVToolNix package):

    FFmpeg:   [ https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ]
    mkvmerge: [ https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html ]

Once installed, ensure the program can be accessed system-wide by calling
the `mkvmerge` or `ffmpeg` command from a terminal/command prompt.
PySceneDetect will automatically use whichever program is available on
the computer, depending on the specified command-line options.

Additionally, certain Windows distributions may include a compiled
Python distribution. For license information regarding the distributed
version of Python, see the LICENSE files in the installation directory,
or visit the following URL: [ https://docs.python.org/3/license.html ]
